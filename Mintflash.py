    "Phase 1: Core Structure & Personnel": [
        {"term": "Let‚Äôs go over what 'MINT' means.", "definition": "MINT is a defensive front used primarily against spread formations. You‚Äôll see 4i‚Äì0‚Äì4i alignments across the line, with a Jack or hybrid edge player outside. It lets us keep two high safeties while still defending the run with numbers.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What type of defense is MINT typically run out of?", "definition": "MINT is most commonly used in a 3-4 defensive structure, often paired with nickel personnel (that‚Äôs five defensive backs). It gives us the flexibility to cover modern spread offenses without sacrificing physicality in the box.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What‚Äôs the role of the STAR?", "definition": "The STAR is your nickel back‚Äîpart linebacker, part corner. He handles slot receivers and adjusts with motion. Big communicator in MINT calls.", "role": "All"}
    ],
    "Phase 2: Pre-Snap Reads": [
        {"term": "Now let‚Äôs focus on what FS is reading.", "definition": "Your eyes are on #2 to the field. If he goes vertical, you stay on top. If he breaks in, close and take away the window. You‚Äôre the last line, but you can also be the playmaker.", "role": "Free Safety (FS)"},
        {"term": "Strong Safety, this one‚Äôs for you.", "definition": "You‚Äôre the boundary enforcer. Track #2 to #1. Your job? Own the curl/flat or insert down into the box. Trap, Robber, Buzz‚Äîknow your fit and bring the hammer.", "role": "Strong Safety (SS)"},
        {"term": "How do we handle a 3x1 set? Let‚Äôs walk through it.", "definition": "Trips to the field? FS cheats that way over the top, SS stays strong on the backside. You may hear a 'Push' or 'Roll' to balance the coverage. Keep your eyes active and communicate.", "role": "Free Safety (FS)"}
    ],
    "Phase 3: Motion Adjustments": [
        {"term": "Let‚Äôs go over what to do when the offense motions.", "definition": "Motion is a communication test. When #2 or #3 shifts, STAR bumps, SS may spin down, and FS might rotate into Cloud or Thin coverage. The key: talk it out and adjust as a unit.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Let‚Äôs talk about what happens if they go Empty.", "definition": "Empty formation means quick threats. In MINT, you may check out entirely. SS might flex wide to pick up #3. The goal: cover space fast and deny the first read.", "role": "Strong Safety (SS)"}
    ],
    "Phase 4: Coverage Responsibilities": [
        {"term": "Now we're going to cover Cover 1.", "definition": "This is man across the board with FS in the post. SS might be in man against the tight end or helping as a low-hole player. Play it tight, and trust your leverage.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Next up: Cover 2 and your deep halves.", "definition": "You and your counterpart are splitting the deep field. Be ready to break on corners and posts. Recognize Smash and Verts‚Äîthose are your money reads.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Let‚Äôs talk about Robber coverage for SS.", "definition": "In Robber, you‚Äôre dropping into the short middle, tracking crossing routes and looking to jump passes. It‚Äôs aggressive‚Äîcommit when you‚Äôre sure.", "role": "Strong Safety (SS)"},
        {"term": "FS, let‚Äôs go over Cloud Coverage.", "definition": "With Cloud, the corner plays flat. You‚Äôre over the top of #1 or bracketing with the STAR or backer. Don‚Äôt let anything leak.", "role": "Free Safety (FS)"}
    ],
    "Phase 5: Terminology Recap": [
        {"term": "Know this: 'Spin', 'Roll', and 'Cloud' calls.", "definition": "'Spin' often means safety rotation. 'Roll' is a coverage shift to a side. 'Cloud' involves the corner playing underneath zone while safety helps over top.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Let‚Äôs talk about route identifiers.", "definition": "#1 = the outside WR, #2 = the slot, #3 = the inside (usually RB or TE). You‚Äôll hear a lot about reading #2‚Äôs release‚Äîvertical, in, or out.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Key check: what does 'Push' mean?", "definition": "Push is a call to shift defenders toward trips formations. It balances out responsibilities to keep coverage intact versus overloaded sides.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "SS, this one‚Äôs a check you‚Äôll need in your pocket.", "definition": "‚ÄòCheck Red‚Äô means fit the run when they motion to trips or tight bunch sets. Drop down, help the box, and close space quickly.", "role": "Strong Safety (SS)"},
        {"term": "Great job! You‚Äôve completed Day 1‚Äôs flashcards.", "definition": "Feel free to review any phase again, or check back soon for Day 2 installation content!", "role": "All"}
