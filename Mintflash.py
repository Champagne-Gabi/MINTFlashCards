    "Phase 1: Core Structure & Personnel": [
        {"term": "Today we‚Äôre going to talk about the MINT Front.", "definition": "The MINT front is a 3-4 defensive structure using a 4i-0-4i front and a stand-up JACK on the edge. It‚Äôs built to handle spread formations while defending the run.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What does 4i-0-4i mean?", "definition": "It refers to the alignment of the defensive linemen: both ends line up on the inside shoulder of the offensive tackles (4i), and the nose tackle is head-up on the center (0).", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Who is the JACK and what‚Äôs their job?", "definition": "The JACK is a hybrid edge player‚Äîpart linebacker, part defensive end. They line up outside the tackle and are responsible for setting the edge or rushing the passer.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "How does the MINT front help against the run?", "definition": "It lets you keep a light box (only 5 defenders) while still covering interior gaps soundly. This frees up the secondary for pass coverage without giving up run integrity.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "How many DBs are in MINT?", "definition": "MINT is typically played with nickel personnel‚Äîso 5 defensive backs. This includes the STAR, who covers the slot and helps with run fits.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Why do we use MINT in this defense?", "definition": "It helps us defend modern spread offenses while sticking to base personnel. It keeps us versatile and able to adapt on the fly.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Next: Select Phase 2 to learn about Pre-Snap Reads", "definition": "Up next, we‚Äôll look at how to read the formation and make smart decisions before the ball is snapped.", "role": "All"}
    ],
    "Phase 2: Pre-Snap Reads": [
        {"term": "Now let‚Äôs dive into Pre-Snap Reads.", "definition": "Before the snap, it‚Äôs crucial to identify offensive formations, personnel groupings, and alignment. This helps anticipate play calls.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What‚Äôs the first thing I should look for?", "definition": "Start by identifying the strength of the formation‚Äîtight end side or wide receiver overload‚Äîand communicate it with your teammates.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "How do I call the strength?", "definition": "Use terms like 'Rip' (right) or 'Liz' (left) to alert others. Make sure this is echoed across the defense.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What else should I scan for pre-snap?", "definition": "Look at the backfield alignment‚Äîpistol, offset, etc.‚Äîand the splits of wide receivers. These give clues about run/pass likelihood.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "How do Free and Strong Safeties differ in reads?", "definition": "FS typically focuses on formation depth and vertical threats, while SS might focus more on run-pass keys and tight end alignment.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What does 'cheat your leverage' mean pre-snap?", "definition": "It means aligning slightly inside or outside your man or zone responsibility based on offensive tendencies and route concepts.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Next: Select Phase 3 to learn about Motion Adjustments", "definition": "In the next phase, you‚Äôll learn how to shift your alignment and coverage when the offense uses pre-snap motion.", "role": "All"}
    ],
    "Phase 3: Motion Adjustments": [
        {"term": "Now we‚Äôre going to talk about Motion Adjustments.", "definition": "Motion is used by the offense to create mismatches or force communication errors. As a safety, you must react quickly and correctly.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What types of motion are common?", "definition": "Watch for jet motion (WR behind QB), return motion (motion out and back), or orbit motion (looping behind QB). Each has a different impact.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "How do I respond to motion pre-snap?", "definition": "Listen for the coverage check or 'bump' call. Stay calm and adjust alignment or responsibilities without overreacting.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What does 'bump across' mean?", "definition": "It means defenders shift laterally in response to motion, often passing off coverage responsibilities. Communication is key.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "How does this affect zone vs. man?", "definition": "In zone, you shift your zone responsibilities. In man, you may travel with the motion or switch men, depending on the call.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Tips for handling fast motion?", "definition": "Anticipate early. Keep your base and angle so you don‚Äôt get caught flat-footed. Don‚Äôt chase ‚Äî communicate and rotate.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Next: Select Phase 4 to learn about Coverage Responsibilities", "definition": "Next up, we‚Äôll break down your zone or man coverage rules in the most common installs.", "role": "All"}
    ],
    "Phase 4: Coverage Responsibilities": [
        {"term": "Now let‚Äôs talk about Coverage Responsibilities.", "definition": "Safeties play a major role in both man and zone coverages. This phase helps you recognize your assignment across calls.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What‚Äôs my job in Cover 1?", "definition": "As a FS, you‚Äôre usually the deep middle help. SS is often in man on a TE or back. Communication pre-snap is key.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What about Cover 3?", "definition": "You‚Äôll each cover a deep third. Read the QB and react quickly to help corners if they get deep verticals.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "How do we defend the seam?", "definition": "In zone (like Cover 3), seam routes are your responsibility as safeties. Use inside leverage and anticipate slot releases.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "What if we‚Äôre in quarters coverage?", "definition": "In quarters, you play a deep quarter but read #2 WR. If #2 goes out, you may rob inside or help on #1.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Tips for transitioning from backpedal", "definition": "Stay square as long as possible, don‚Äôt open hips early. Read route stems and anticipate breaks.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Next: Select Phase 5 to review Terminology Recap", "definition": "Next up is a summary of the most important calls and concepts to remember from Day 1.", "role": "All"}
    ],
    "Phase 5: Terminology Recap": [
        {"term": "Let‚Äôs review some key terminology.", "definition": "You‚Äôve covered a lot today. This phase reviews the most critical terms so you can lock them in.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Rip/Liz", "definition": "Used to call formation strength. 'Rip' = strength to the right. 'Liz' = strength to the left.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Jack", "definition": "The stand-up edge player in the MINT front. Responsible for contain, sometimes rush, sometimes drop.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "STAR", "definition": "The nickel DB, usually lines up over the slot. Big role in coverage and run fits.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Bump/Bump Across", "definition": "A defensive adjustment to offensive motion. Everyone shifts down a gap or across their zone.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "Eyes/Leverage", "definition": "Keep your eyes disciplined. Leverage means staying outside/inside depending on the coverage call.", "role": "All"},
        {"term": "You‚Äôve completed Day 1!", "definition": "Great job. Review these terms anytime, and get ready to build on this tomorrow.", "role": "All"}
